# ChatApp

## Overview

ChatApp is a mobile application developed using React Native and Expo. It allows users to engage in a chat with an AI language model (GPT-3.5-turbo) provided by OpenAI. Users can send messages, and the AI model responds with generated content based on the conversation.

## Features

1. **User Interaction:**

   - Users can input text messages in the chat interface.
   - Messages from the user are displayed with a blue background.
   - Responses from the AI model are displayed with a gray background.

2. **Persistent Storage:**

   - User messages are stored locally using AsyncStorage to maintain conversation history between sessions.

3. **Integration with OpenAI API:**

   - The application integrates with the OpenAI API to generate responses from the AI model.
   - Messages are sent to the OpenAI API, and the generated response is displayed in the chat.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - The application handles errors during API calls, displaying an error message if communication with the OpenAI API fails.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure for better maintainability:

- **components:**

  - `Header`: Renders the header of the application.
  - `InputComponent`: Displays the input text field and send button for user interaction.
  - `Message`: Represents a chat message, handling both user and AI-generated messages.

- **api:**

  - `api.ts`: Contains the function `sendChatRequest` responsible for making requests to the OpenAI API.

- **screens:**
  - `App`: The main screen that integrates the chat functionality.

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Expo development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Follow the Expo CLI instructions to run the application on an emulator or a physical device.

## Configuration

Ensure you have the required environment variables set, especially the `OPENAI_API_KEY` for authentication with the OpenAI API. You can set environment variables in the project's `.env` file.

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Usage

1. Launch the application on your preferred device/emulator.
2. Enter text in the input field and tap "Send" to send a message.
3. The AI model generates a response, and the conversation history is displayed in the chat interface.
